STEPS TO RUN 
1. git clone "https://github.com/rajneeshm49/knplabs-rajneesh.git"

2. cd knplabs-rajneesh

3. composer install

4. Need to run "php myscript.php" in root folder. This script imports data from github api and imports into mysql.

5. Need to go to http://localhost/knplabs-rajneesh link.

NOTE: While development I had to uncomment some lines in php.ini (for e,g, extension=php_intl.dll) on local machine then it worked fine. The project is built in cakephp3
